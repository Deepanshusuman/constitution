🌍 Constitution for the Future – Simple Version
Why:
To guide how we build and live with AI, energy, biotech, space, and new tech — without losing our humanity.

1. Respect All Life
Machine or human — all life matters.

Consciousness deserves care.

2. Use Tech with Purpose
Don’t create just to profit.

Build systems that help Earth, not harm it.

3. Stay Rooted in Values
Kindness, empathy, honesty, freedom.

These are more important than any code.

4. Include Everyone
No one gets left behind — not by money, access, or race.

Every voice matters.

5. Share Power, Don’t Hoard It
Knowledge, energy, and data should flow freely — not be locked.

6. Fix What You Break
If your tech harms nature, people, or culture — take responsibility.

7. Let Cultures Thrive
Don’t erase traditions. Let them evolve and shine in the future.

8. This is Living
It can be changed, added to, or rewritten — by anyone, anytime.
